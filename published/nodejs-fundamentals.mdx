## I. Introduction to Node.js

### 1. What is Node.js?

**Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side.
It provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient for building scalable network applications.

### 2. Installation and setup

To install Node.js, you can download the installer from the official website (https://nodejs.org).
Once downloaded, run the installer and follow the installation instructions.
To verify that Node.js is installed correctly, you can open your terminal or command prompt and type **node -v** to check the version.

### 3. Hello World with Node.js

To write your first Node.js program, create a new file called index.js and add the following code:

```js
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where **index.js** is located.
Type **node index.js** to run the program.
You should see **Hello, World!** printed in the console.

## II. Asynchronous programming in Node.js

### 1. Understanding asynchronous programming in Node.js

**Asynchronous programming** in Node.js allows you to perform I/O operations without blocking the execution of your program.
Node.js uses an event-driven architecture to handle asynchronous operations, which means that callbacks are used to signal when a task is complete.
This allows Node.js to handle large numbers of concurrent connections efficiently.

### 2. Callbacks, Promises, and Async/Await

Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are called when a task is complete.

```js
// Example of a callback
function getData(callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    callback("Data");
  }, 1000);
}

getData((data) => {
  console.log(data); // Output: Data
});
```

**Promises** were introduced in ES6 and provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations.

```js
// Example of a Promise
function getData() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("Data");
    }, 1000);
  });
}

getData().then((data) => {
  console.log(data); // Output: Data
});
```

**Async/Await** is a newer feature in JavaScript that allows you to write asynchronous code that looks like synchronous code.

```js
// Example of Async/Await
async function getData() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("Data");
    }, 1000);
  });
}

async function main() {
  const data = await getData();
  console.log(data); // Output: Data
}

main();
```

### 3. Handling errors in asynchronous programming

When working with asynchronous code, it's important to handle errors properly.
With callbacks, you can pass an error as the first argument to the callback function.

```js
// Example of handling errors with callbacks
function getData(callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    const error = new Error("Unable to get data");
    callback(error, null);
  }, 1000);
}

getData((error, data) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } else {
    console.log(data);
  }
});
```

With Promises, you can use the catch method to handle errors.

```js
// Example of handling errors with Promises
function getData() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const error = new Error("Unable to get data");
      reject(error);
    }, 1000);
  });
}

getData()
  .then((data) => {
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

With Async/Await, you can use a try...catch block to handle errors.
javascript

```js
// Example of handling errors with Async/Await
async function getData() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const error = new Error("Unable to get data");
      reject(error);
    }, 1000);
  });
}

async function main() {
  try {
    const data = await getData();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

main();
```

## III. Introduction to Express.js

### 1. What is Express.js?

**Express.js** is a popular web application framework for Node.js that provides a set of features for building web applications and APIs.
It provides a minimalist approach to web development with a simple, flexible, and powerful API.

### 2. Installation and setup

To install Express.js, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory.
Type npm install express to install the package.
Once installed, you can start using Express.js in your project by requiring it at the top of your JavaScript file:

```js
const express = require("express");
```

### 3. Building a basic Express.js app

To build a basic Express.js app, create a new file called app.js and add the following code:

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello, World!");
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server started on port 3000");
});
```

This code creates an Express.js app, defines a route for the home page ('/'), and starts the server listening on port 3000.
To run the app, type node app.js in your terminal or command prompt.
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the message "Hello, World!" displayed.

### 4. Routing in Express.js

**Routing** in Express.js allows you to define routes for different URLs and HTTP methods.
To define a route, use the app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER) syntax, where METHOD is an HTTP method (e.g. get, post, put, delete), PATH is a path on the server, and HANDLER is a function that handles the request and response.

```js
// Example of a route in Express.js
app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
res.send('List of users');
});
You can also use route parameters to handle dynamic URLs.
javascript
Copy code
// Example of a route with parameters in Express.js
app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
const id = req.params.id;
res.send(`User ${id}`);
});
```

You can chain route handlers together using the app.route() method.

```js
// Example of chained route handlers in Express.js
app
  .route("/users")
  .get((req, res) => {
    res.send("List of users");
  })
  .post((req, res) => {
    res.send("Create a new user");
  })
  .put((req, res) => {
    res.send("Update a user");
  })
  .delete((req, res) => {
    res.send("Delete a user");
  });
```

## IV. Handling HTTP requests in Express.js

### 1. Handling GET and POST requests

In Express.js, you can handle **GET** and **POST** requests using the app.get() and app.post() methods, respectively.
To handle a GET request for a specific URL, use the app.get() method and specify the URL path and a callback function that sends the response back to the client.

```js
app.get("/home", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello, world!");
});
```

To handle a POST request for a specific URL, use the app.post() method and specify the URL path and a callback function that handles the request data and sends the response back to the client.

```js
app.post("/login", (req, res) => {
  const username = req.body.username;
  const password = req.body.password;
  // handle login logic here
  res.send("Logged in successfully");
});
```

### 2. Middleware in Express.js

**Middleware** in Express.js refers to functions that are executed in the middle of the request-response cycle.
Middleware functions have access to the request and response objects and can perform tasks such as logging, authentication, and error handling.
To use middleware in your Express.js app, use the app.use() method and specify the middleware function.

```js
// Example of middleware that logs requests
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`Received ${req.method} request for ${req.url}`);
  next();
});
```

You can also use third-party middleware packages such as body-parser to parse request bodies and morgan to log requests.

### 3. Understanding request and response objects

In Express.js, the **request and response objects** represent the HTTP request and response, respectively.
The request object contains information about the request, such as the URL, headers, and request body.
The response object contains methods for sending the response back to the client, such as send(), json(), and render().

```js
// Example of using request and response objects in Express.js
app.get("/users/:id", (req, res) => {
  const id = req.params.id;
  const name = req.query.name;
  const age = req.query.age;
  // handle user lookup logic here
  res.send(`User ${id} with name ${name} and age ${age}`);
});
```

### 4. Serving static files

In Express.js, you can serve static files such as HTML, CSS, and images using the express.static() middleware function.
To serve static files, create a directory called public in your project directory and place your static files inside it.
Then use the express.static() function to serve the files.

```js
// Example of serving static files in Express.js
app.use(express.static("public"));
```

You can now access your static files by navigating to http://localhost:3000/filename.html, where filename.html is the name of your HTML file.

## V. Connecting to databases with Node.js and Express.js

### 1. Introduction to databases

A **database** is a collection of data that is organized in a way that enables efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data.
Databases are used to store data for web applications, mobile apps, and other software systems.
There are different types of databases, including relational databases (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite), NoSQL databases (such as MongoDB, CouchDB, and Cassandra), and in-memory databases (such as Redis and Memcached).

### 2. Connecting to a database with Node.js

To connect to a database in Node.js, you can use a database driver or ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library.
A database driver is a low-level library that provides a direct interface to the database, while an ORM library provides a higher-level abstraction that allows you to interact with the database using objects and models.
Some popular database drivers for Node.js include mysql, pg (for PostgreSQL), sqlite3, and mongodb.
Some popular ORM libraries for Node.js include Sequelize, TypeORM, and Mongoose.
To connect to a database using a database driver or ORM, you need to provide the database credentials and connection details, such as the host, port, database name, username, and password.

### 3. Using Sequelize ORM for database operations

**Sequelize** is a popular ORM library for Node.js that supports multiple database systems, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.
Sequelize provides an easy-to-use API for defining database models, performing database operations (such as create, read, update, and delete), and handling database relationships (such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many).
To use Sequelize in your Express.js app, you need to install the sequelize and sequelize-cli packages and configure the database connection.
You also need to define your database models using Sequelize's model definition syntax.

```js
// Example of defining a Sequelize model for a user
const { DataTypes } = require("sequelize");
const sequelize = require("./sequelize");

const User = sequelize.define(
  "User",
  {
    id: {
      type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
      allowNull: false,
      autoIncrement: true,
      primaryKey: true,
    },
    name: {
      type: DataTypes.STRING,
      allowNull: false,
    },
    email: {
      type: DataTypes.STRING,
      allowNull: false,
      unique: true,
    },
    password: {
      type: DataTypes.STRING,
      allowNull: false,
    },
  },
  {
    timestamps: true,
    tableName: "users",
  }
);
```

You can then use the Sequelize API to perform database operations, such as creating a new user, retrieving all users, updating a user, and deleting a user.

```js
// Example of using Sequelize to create a new user
const User = require("./models/User");

app.post("/users", async (req, res) => {
  const { name, email, password } = req.body;
  try {
    const user = await User.create({ name, email, password });
    res.json(user);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    res.status(500).send("Server error");
  }
});
```

### 4. Handling database errors

When working with databases in Node.js and Express.js, it is important to handle database errors properly to avoid crashes and security vulnerabilities.
Sequelize provides built-in error handling for database errors, which can be caught using a try-catch block or a promise catch block.
You can also use middleware functions in Express.js to handle database errors and return appropriate error responses to the client.
It is important to sanitize and validate user input before performing database operations to prevent SQL injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities.

## VI. Authentication and Authorization in Node.js and Express.js

### 1. User authentication and authorization basics

User authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, typically by asking for a username and password.
User authorization is the process of determining whether a user has access to a particular resource or feature.
Authentication and authorization are critical for securing web applications and protecting user data from unauthorized access.

### 2. Passport.js authentication middleware

**Passport.js** is a popular authentication middleware for Node.js and Express.js that provides a flexible and modular API for handling user authentication and authorization.
Passport.js supports various authentication strategies, such as local authentication (using username and password), OAuth (for third-party authentication providers such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter), and JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
To use Passport.js in an Express.js app, you need to install the passport and passport-local (or other passport strategy) packages and configure the authentication strategy.
You also need to define routes for handling user authentication (such as login, logout, and signup) and protected routes that require user authentication.

```js
const passport = require("passport");
const LocalStrategy = require("passport-local").Strategy;

passport.use(
  new LocalStrategy(function (username, password, done) {
    User.findOne({ username: username }, function (err, user) {
      if (err) {
        return done(err);
      }
      if (!user) {
        return done(null, false);
      }
      if (!user.verifyPassword(password)) {
        return done(null, false);
      }
      return done(null, user);
    });
  })
);

app.post(
  "/login",
  passport.authenticate("local", { failureRedirect: "/login" }),
  function (req, res) {
    res.redirect("/dashboard");
  }
);

app.get("/logout", function (req, res) {
  req.logout();
  res.redirect("/");
});
```

### 3. Implementing authentication and authorization in an Express.js app

To implement **user authentication and authorization** in an Express.js app, you can use Passport.js middleware to handle user authentication and store user information in a session or a JWT token.
You can also use middleware functions to check whether a user is authenticated and authorized to access a particular route or resource.
It is important to secure user passwords by hashing and salting them before storing them in a database, and to use secure protocols (such as HTTPS) for transmitting user data over the network.

```js
// Middleware function to check if user is authenticated
function isAuthenticated(req, res, next) {
  if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
    return next();
  }
  res.redirect("/login");
}

// Route to display dashboard for authenticated users
app.get("/dashboard", isAuthenticated, function (req, res) {
  res.render("dashboard", { user: req.user });
});

// Route to handle user login
app.post(
  "/login",
  passport.authenticate("local", { failureRedirect: "/login" }),
  function (req, res) {
    res.redirect("/dashboard");
  }
);

// Route to handle user logout
app.get("/logout", function (req, res) {
  req.logout();
  res.redirect("/");
});
```

### 4. Session management with Express-session

**Express-session** is a middleware for managing user sessions in an Express.js app.
Express-session provides a simple and flexible API for storing session data on the server-side and associating it with a unique session ID that is sent to the client in a cookie.
Session data can be used to store user information, such as the user ID and authentication status, and to implement features such as remember me and session timeouts.
To use Express-session in an Express.js app, you need to install the express-session package and configure the session middleware with options such as the session store, cookie settings, and session secret.
You can then use the req.session object to store and retrieve session data in your routes and middleware functions.

```js
const session = require("express-session");
const MongoStore = require("connect-mongo")(session);

app.use(
  session({
    secret: "mysecretkey",
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    store: new MongoStore({ url: "mongodb://localhost/myapp" }),
    cookie: { maxAge: 60 * 60 * 1000 }, // Session expires in 1 hour
  })
);

// Middleware function to add user to session
app.use(function (req, res, next) {
  if (req.user) {
    req.session.user = req.user;
  }
  next();
});

// Middleware function to check if user is authenticated
function isAuthenticated(req, res, next) {
  if (req.session.user) {
    return next();
  }
  res.redirect("/login");
}

// Route to display dashboard for authenticated users
app.get("/dashboard", isAuthenticated, function (req, res) {
  res.render("dashboard", { user: req.session.user });
});

// Route to handle user login
app.post(
  "/login",
  passport.authenticate("local", { failureRedirect: "/login" }),
  function (req, res) {
    req.session.user = req.user;
    res.redirect("/dashboard");
  }
);

// Route to handle user logout
app.get("/logout", function (req, res) {
  req.session.destroy();
  res.redirect("/");
});
```

## VII. Real-time applications with Node.js and Express.js

### 1. Understanding real-time applications

**Real-time applications** are those that require immediate response and interaction between the server and the client. Examples of real-time applications include chat apps, multiplayer games, and live streaming applications. In a real-time application, data needs to be sent and received in real-time, without any delay.

### 2. WebSockets and socket.io

**WebSockets** are a protocol that enables bidirectional communication between the client and the server over a single, long-lived connection. WebSockets allow real-time communication between the server and the client without the need for HTTP requests and responses, which can be slow and resource-intensive.

**Socket.io** is a popular Node.js library that provides an easy-to-use API for working with WebSockets. It allows real-time, event-based communication between the server and the client, and can also fallback to other transport mechanisms, such as long-polling, if WebSockets are not supported by the client or the server.

### 3. Building a real-time chat app with Node.js and socket.io

Here is an example of how to build a real-time chat app with Node.js and socket.io:

```js
// Server-side code
const express = require('express');
const http = require('http');
const socketIO = require('socket.io');

const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);
const io = socketIO(server);

app.use(express.static(\_\_dirname + '/public'));

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
console.log('New client connected');

socket.on('join', (data) => {
socket.join(data.room);
console.log(`${data.name} joined room ${data.room}`);
socket.broadcast.to(data.room).emit('new user', { name: data.name });
});

socket.on('send message', (data) => {
console.log(`Message sent to room ${data.room} by ${data.name}: ${data.message}`);
socket.broadcast.to(data.room).emit('new message', { name: data.name, message: data.message });
});

socket.on('disconnect', () => {
console.log('Client disconnected');
});
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});
```

In this example, we first set up an Express.js server and a **socket.io** instance. We then serve static files from the public directory using the express.static() middleware.

When a new client connects to the server, we log a message to the console and add event listeners for the join and send message events. The join event is triggered when a user joins a chat room, and we add the user to the room using the socket.join() method. We then broadcast a new user event to all other users in the room using the socket.broadcast.to() method.

The send message event is triggered when a user sends a message in the chat room. We log the message to the console and broadcast a new message event to all other users in the room.

Finally, we add an event listener for the disconnect event, which is triggered when a client disconnects from the server.

## VIII. Deploying Node.js and Express.js apps

Deployment is an important aspect of any application development. Node.js and Express.js applications can be deployed to a variety of platforms, including Heroku and AWS.

### 1. Deployment options for Node.js and Express.js apps
