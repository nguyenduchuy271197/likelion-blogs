## I. Introduction

### 1. What is HTML?

**HTML** stands for **HyperText Markup Language** and is a standard markup language used to create and structure web content. HTML defines the structure and content of a web page, using a set of tags and attributes to describe the text, images, links, and other elements that make up a webpage. HTML is used in conjunction with other technologies, such as CSS and JavaScript, to create dynamic and interactive web pages.

### 2. Purposes of HTML

- To structure and organize content on the web, such as text, images, videos, and links.
- To define the semantic meaning of content, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and other elements.
- To create a visually appealing and easy-to-use interface for users to interact with web content.
- To provide a way to embed multimedia elements, such as videos and images, into web pages.
- To allow web developers to create dynamic and interactive web pages using scripting languages, such as JavaScript.
- To provide a standardized format that can be rendered by web browsers, ensuring that web pages can be viewed on a variety of devices.
- To enable search engines to easily index and understand the content of web pages, improving search engine optimization (SEO).
- To create web applications and complex web-based systems that can be accessed from anywhere with an Internet connection.

## II. HTML Document Structure

Here is an example of a simple HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Main content -->
  </body>
</html>
```

An HTML document has a basic structure that includes the following elements:

- **DOCTYPE declaration**: This line specifies the version of HTML being used in the document.
- **HTML element**: This is the root element of the document and contains all other elements.
- **Head element**: The head element contains meta information about the document, such as the title of the page, which is displayed in the browser tab, and links to CSS and JavaScript files.
- **Body element**: The body element contains the main content of the document, including text, images, videos, and other elements.

## VII. HTML Forms

**HTML forms** are used to collect data from users. They allow you to create input fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, drop-down lists, and other elements that let users interact with your web page.

```html
<form action="https://www.example.com/submit-form" method="post">
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required />

  <label for="email">Email:</label>

  <label for="password">Password:</label>
  <input type="password" id="password" name="password" required />

  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```

- **form** tag: used to define the form and its properties.
- **action**: attribute specifies the URL that the form data will be sent to when it's submitted
- **method**: attribute specifies the HTTP method to be used for sending the form data (in this case, **post**).
- **input** tag: define the different fields that the user can interact with.

## VII. HTML Tables

**HTML tables** are used to represent tabular data on a web page. They allow you to organize data into rows and columns, making it easier to understand and compare data.

```html
<table>
  <thead>

      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Email</th>
      <th>Country</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>John Doe</td>
      <td>johndoe@example.com</td>
      <td>USA</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Jane Doe</td>
      <td>janedoe@example.com</td>
      <td>Canada</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>Australia</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

- **table**: used to define the table and its properties
- **thead**: contains the header row
- **tbody**: contains the data rows
- **tr**: represent for each row
- **td**: represent for each cell

> The header row is defined using **th** elements instead of **td** elements, as header cells are typically displayed differently from regular data cells.

## VIII. Web Accessibility

**Web accessibility** refers to making web content and web applications usable by people with disabilities

### 1. Use semantic HTML elements

**Semantic elements**, such as **header**, **nav**, **main**, **article**, and **footer**, give structure to your web page and provide information about its content to assistive technologies, such as **screen readers**. Example:

```html
<header>
  <h1>My Web Page</h1>
</header>
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
    <li><a href="#services">Services</a></li>
    <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
<main>
  <h2>Welcome to My Web Page</h2>
  <p>This is the main content of my web page.</p>
</main>
<footer>
  <p>Copyright &copy; 2023 My Company</p>
</footer>
```

### 2. Use descriptive and meaningful text

**Descriptive text**, such as **alt text** for images, can help users understand the content of your web page even if they can't see the images. Example:

```html
<img src="dog.jpg" alt="A picture of a cute dog" />
```

### 3. Provide captions and transcripts

**Captions and transcripts** help users who are deaf or hard of hearing understand audio and video content. Example:

```html
<video controls>
  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <track src="captions.vtt" kind="captions" srclang="en" label="English" />
</video>
```

### 4. Make sure your site is keyboard accessible

**Keyboard accessibility** is important for users who cannot use a mouse, such as those with disabilities. Example:

```html
<button type="button">Click Me</button>
```
